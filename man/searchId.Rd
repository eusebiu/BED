\title{Search identifier, symbol or name information}
\usage{
searchId(searched, be = NULL, organism = NULL, ncharSymb = 4,
  ncharName = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{searched}{the searched term. Identifiers are searched by exact match.
Symbols and names are also searched for partial match when searched is
greater than ncharSymb and ncharName respectively.}

\item{be}{optional. If provided the search is focused on provided BEs.}

\item{organism}{optional.  If provided the search is focused on provided
organisms.}

\item{ncharSymb}{The minimum number of characters in searched to consider
incomplete symbol matches.}

\item{ncharName}{The minimum number of characters in searched to consider
incomplete name matches.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following fields:\itemize{
\item{found: the element found in BED corresponding to the searched term}
\item{be: the type of the element}
\item{source: the source of the element}
\item{organism: the related organism}
\item{entity: the related entity internal ID}
\item{ebe: the BE of the related entity}
\item{canonical: if the symbol is canonical}
\item{gene: list of the related genes BE internal ID}
}
Exact matches are returned first folowed by the shortest elements.

\description{
This function is meant to be used with \code{\link{getRelevantIds}} in order
to implement a dictonary of identifiers of interest. First
the \code{\link{searchId}} function is used to search a term.
Then the \code{\link{getRelevantIds}} function
is used to find the corresponding ID in a context of interest.
