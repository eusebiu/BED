\title{Feeding BED: Download Ensembl DB and load peptide information in BED}
\usage{
getEnsemblPeptideIds(organism, release, gv, dbCref, canChromosomes)
}
\arguments{
\item{organism}{character vector of 1 element corresponding to the organism
of interest (e.g. "Homo sapiens")}

\item{release}{the Ensembl release of interest (e.g. "83")}

\item{gv}{the genome version (e.g. "38")}

\item{dbCref}{a named vector of characters providing cross-reference DB of
interest. These DB are also used to find indirect ID associations.}

\item{canChromosomes}{canonical chromosmomes to be considered as preferred
ID (e.g. c(1:22, "X", "Y", "MT") for human)}
}

Not exported to avoid unintended modifications of the DB.
